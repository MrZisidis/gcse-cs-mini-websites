🎃 GCSE CS: Interactive Halloween Turtle Worksheet
This is a single-page, interactive HTML application designed as a self-contained lesson for GCSE (Grade 11) Computer Science students. It uses a fun Halloween theme—drawing a spooky spiderweb—to teach and review fundamental Python Turtle concepts.
The worksheet is built with plain HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
Features

Interactive Quiz: A "Check Your Understanding" section with multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and true/false questions.
Self-Marking: A "Mark My Work" button that instantly calculates the student's score, provides a percentage, and lists specific topics for revision.
Printable Report: A "Generate Report" button that creates a printable summary of the student's score, feedback, and submitted answers, which is ideal for assessment.
